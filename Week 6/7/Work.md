  Hello "Blank"
I just happened to see your post here on this article and that is something that interests me as well. I recently graduated from a coding bootcamp, and I was wondering if you had any advice on how to get better on whitboard challenges for interviews.

Hello "Blank"
I have recently been working on a project about "Insert project here" in web developement. It is super cool! I am really interested in making a really high quality polished product. Are there any hints or pieces of advice that you could give me to help me with "problem"?

Hello "Blank"
I saw that you are connected to "so and so" on linked in. I also know "so and so" "tell them how I know them."
How did you get to know or how do you know them?

My only real work experience is in fast food. I was into management in both areas, so I could use those for management and team building examples, but I am not sure that I should really put them on my Linkedin... I would also love to set up a time where I could talk to you one on one about my linked in because it makes me a little nervous. Can I also include my time in Boise Code works as part of my experience?
