## White board peer exampls

# Folded Paper:
Today I participated in a whiteboard challenge. Jason gave me the problem. I had to find the height of a paper given a variable n for number of folds on the paper. The paper at default was .5 millimeters thick. Every time the paper folded the width doubled. I had to return the width in meters for the challenge. It was a good challenge and I was able to figure it out with some help from Jason. 
I need to practice and know my array methods though. I knew what I wanted to do with an array function I just forgot the syntax for the push method. I also wish that I would have communicated with Jason better about what I was doing and what I was thinking about.


# Nums length array
Today I also participated with Kris doing a whiteboard challenge. We did the same problem at the same time and this challenge was that they wanted us to return an array given two numbers. The first being the value of the first index, and the second one being the number for the length of the array. On each index the number needed to double. So for example if the input was (7,5) the output would be [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]. This challenge went really well. I feel like I knew what I was doing and I was able to talk things out fairly well. Nathan and Justin were listening to us both respectively. I wish that I would have really dialed in on talking and making eye contact with the person 'interviewing' me.
