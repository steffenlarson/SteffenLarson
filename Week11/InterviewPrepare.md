## What can I do to prepare for an interview?

I want to research the company. I want to see who is at the top of the company and see what the companys mission statement is. I want to learn as much as I can about the company. I want to talk to previous employees and I want to talk to current employees to understand their perspective on what the company. I want to know what services and products the company provides for its clients. I want to research and know, if possible, who will be interviewing me. I want to know what the atmosphere and the culture are like. I want to know the volunteer work that the company takes a part in. I want to know how the company interacts with their customers and clients. I want to practice my elevator pitch and I want to before hand have a list of questions for my interviewer. I want to follow everyone that I can on Linked in from that company. I want to have several projects ready for display. I will have a folder ready with a copy of my resume inside of it. I want to before I go in have examples ready in my brain of my accomplishments. 

I want to make sure that I look clean cut and that I smell good. I want to make sure that I am well rested and that I am warm and friendly while at the premises. I want to know everything that I can about the place where I am interviewing in.
