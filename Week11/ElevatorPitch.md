## Elevator Pitch Draft:

Hi my name is Steffen Larson.
I have worked in the food and customer service industry for the past 10 years. After moving through different management and leadership positions I found myself wanting more. I have always had a desire to learn more about technology and computers that I never really pursued. I had a friend who graduated a coding bootcamp and he told me a lot about it. I started looking into that bootcamp (Boise Codeworks). With Covid last year, the rstaurant industry took a huge hit and this allowed me to pursue a career change. I started looking into software development and I decided that I wanted to learn more. I took a chance and made a change. I found that I really enjoyed the design and creation aspects to software development. I have found a passion for building and designing web applications. Through this course I have made so much progress and I have made many functional applications on the web. I am excited to dive into a new code base and I am excited to learn more about creating functional and efficient web applications. I want to make something that matters and create things that can accomplish something. I have always been committed to excellence in my past work history and I cannot wait to trasnlate those soft skills into a new work environment.
