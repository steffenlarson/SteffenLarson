## Elevator Pitch Draft:

Hi my name is Steffen Larson.
I have worked in the food and customer service industry for the past 10 years. I found myself wanting more after moving through different management and leadership positions. I have always had a desire that I never really persued to learn more about technology and computers. I started looking into software development and I found that I enjoyed the design and creation aspects to software development. I have found a passion for building and designing web applications that I did not initially think that I was going to find. I had a friend who graduated a coding bootcamp and he told me about it. I started looking into Boise Codeworks and I decided that I needed a change in my life. I have learned so many useful skills and I have grown into a true developer. I am really looking forward to honing my coding skills and learning even more about all the different ways of creating functional and fun web apps. I want to make something that matters and create things that can do something. I have always been committed to excellence in my past work history and I cannot wait to trasnlate those soft skills into a new work environment.
